## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher (tested with Python 3.13)
- Windows 10/11 (optimized for Windows)

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone or download the project**
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/alokumarjaiswal/gmaps_scraper.git"
cd gmaps_scraper
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Install Playwright browsers**
```bash
playwright install
```

## 🎯 Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Update the target URL** in `main.py`:
```python
business_url = "YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_BUSINESS_URL_HERE"
```

2. **Run the scraper**:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
from core.extractors.data_extractor import DataExtractor

# Create extractor instance (now uses modular architecture)
extractor = DataExtractor(page)

# Each method delegates to specialized extractors
basic_info = extractor.extract_basic_info()        # → BasicInfoExtractor
contact_info = extractor.extract_contact_info()    # → ContactExtractor
reviews = extractor.extract_reviews_tab_info()     # → ReviewsExtractor
```

### Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize all aspects of the scraper:
- **Browser settings**: Headless mode, viewport size, user agent, launch arguments
- **Timeout values**: Page load, element wait, screenshots, navigation
- **CSS selectors**: All Google Maps elements (centrally managed for easy updates)
- **Output configuration**: File names and directory structure
- **Photo extraction settings**: Delays, thresholds, load times
- **Logging configuration**: Level, format, output

#### Selector Management
All CSS selectors are now centrally managed in `config.py` under the `SELECTORS` dictionary:
```python
SELECTORS = {
    # Basic business info
    "business_name_en": "h1.DUwDvf",
    "rating": '.F7nice span[aria-hidden="true"]',
    
    # Review extraction
    "review_container": 'div.jftiEf[data-review-id]',
    "review_more_button": 'button.w8nwRe.kyuRq[aria-label="See more"]',
    "reviewer_name_div": 'div.d4r55',
    
    # And many more...
}
```

This centralized approach makes it easy to update selectors when Google Maps changes their HTML structure.

### 🏗️ Modular Extractor Architecture

The scraper now features a **modular extractor architecture** with single responsibility principle:

- **`DataExtractor`**: Main orchestrator that coordinates all specialized extractors
- **`BaseExtractor`**: Common base class providing shared functionality and imports
- **`BasicInfoExtractor`**: Extracts hero image, business names, rating, reviews, business type, accessibility
- **`ContactExtractor`**: Handles address, phone, website, plus code, services URL extraction
- **`OperationalExtractor`**: Manages status, weekly hours, and special features extraction
- **`PopularTimesExtractor`**: Specialized extraction of busy times data with day navigation
- **`AboutExtractor`**: Comprehensive About tab information categorization and extraction
- **`ReviewsExtractor`**: Advanced review extraction with multi-pass expansion and owner responses

This architecture provides:
- ✅ **Better maintainability**: Each extractor focuses on one responsibility
- ✅ **Easier testing**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
- ✅ **Enhanced extensibility**: New extractors can be added without affecting existing ones
- ✅ **Cleaner code**: Logical separation of concerns

    "slow_mo": 50,             # Delay between actions (ms)
    "viewport": {"width": 1280, "height": 800}
}
```

### Timeout Settings

    "tab_load_threshold": 5     # Number of tabs that indicate a successful load
}
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No such element" errors**
   - Google Maps layout may have changed
   - Update selectors in `config.py` under the `SELECTORS` dictionary
   - All selectors are now centrally managed for easy maintenance
   - Check if business page loaded correctly

2. **Browser crashes**
   - Increase timeout values in `config.py`
   - Run in headless mode by modifying browser settings
   - Check available system memory

3. **Empty data extraction**
   - Verify the Google Maps URL is correct
   - Check if business page is publicly accessible
   - Review console logs for specific errors

4. **Photo extraction fails**
   - Some businesses may have limited photo categories
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify photo tab navigation is working

5. **Review extraction incomplete**
   - Some reviews may have collapsed text that requires multiple "More" button clicks
   - The scraper uses a multi-pass strategy to expand all content
   - Check logs for "More button" click attempts and success rates

6. **Services URL not extracted**
   - Not all businesses have services URLs
   - Check if the business has a "Services" link on their Google Maps page
   - Look for "Services URL extracted: [URL or Not found]" in the logs

7. **Python 3.13 Compatibility Issues**
   - Use: `pip install playwright==1.40.0` for best compatibility
   - Ensure all dependencies are up to date

### Debugging

Enable detailed logging by modifying the `LOGGING_CONFIG` in `config.py`:
```python
LOGGING_CONFIG = {
    "level": "DEBUG",  # Change from "INFO" to "DEBUG"
    "format": "%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s",
    "encoding": "utf-8"
}
```

## 📝 Development

### Adding New Features

1. **New data extraction**: 
   - Create a new specialized extractor in `core/extractors/`
   - Inherit from `BaseExtractor` for shared functionality
   - Add to `DataExtractor` orchestrator for integration
2. **New navigation**: Add methods to `core/navigator.py`  
3. **New data fields**: Update `models/business_profile.py`
4. **New configuration**: Add to `config.py`
5. **New selectors**: Add CSS selectors to the `SELECTORS` dictionary in `config.py`

### Creating Custom Extractors

To add a new extractor module:

```python
# core/extractors/custom_extractor.py
from .base_extractor import BaseExtractor

class CustomExtractor(BaseExtractor):
    """Extract custom business information."""
    
    def extract_custom_data(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Extract custom data from the page."""
        logger.info("Extracting custom data...")
        
        try:
            # Use inherited helper methods and imports
            element = self.page.locator(self.selectors["custom_selector"]).first
            data = self.safe_extract_text(element)
            
            logger.info("✅ Custom data extracted successfully")
            return {"custom_field": data}
            
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"❌ Error extracting custom data: {e}")
            return {}
```

Then integrate it into the main `DataExtractor`:

```python
# core/extractors/data_extractor.py
from .custom_extractor import CustomExtractor

class DataExtractor:
    def __init__(self, page: Page):
        # ...existing extractors...
        self.custom_extractor = CustomExtractor(page)
    
    def extract_custom_data(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        return self.custom_extractor.extract_custom_data()
```

### Updating Selectors

When Google Maps changes their HTML structure:
1. Open `config.py`
2. Locate the `SELECTORS` dictionary
3. Update the relevant CSS selector
4. All modules will automatically use the updated selector

### Code Style

The project follows Python best practices:
- Type hints for all functions
- Comprehensive error handling
- Modular, reusable components
- Clear logging and documentation
